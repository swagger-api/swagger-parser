# Swagger Parser

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/swagger-api/swagger-parser.png)](https://travis-ci.org/swagger-api/swagger-parser)

## Overview
This is the swagger parser project, which reads swagger specifications into current Java POJOs.  It also provides a simple framework to add additional converters from different formats into the Swagger objects, making the entire toolchain available.

Check out [Swagger-Spec](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-spec) for additional information about the Swagger project, including additional libraries with support for other languages and more. 


### Usage
Using the swagger-parser is simple.  Once included in your project, you can read a swagger specification from any location:

```java
import io.swagger.parser.SwaggerParser;
import io.swagger.models.Swagger;

// ... your code

  // read a swagger description from the petstore
  Swagger swagger = new SwaggerParser().read("http://petstore.swagger.io/v2/swagger.json");
```

You can read from a file location as well:
```java
  Swagger swagger = new SwaggerParser().read("./path/to/swagger.json");

```

And with the swagger-compat-spec-parser module, you can read older formats, and convert them into swagger 2.0:
```java
  Swagger swagger = new SwaggerParser().read("http://petstore.swagger.io/api/api-docs");
```

If your swagger resource is protected, you can pass headers in the request:
```java
import io.swagger.models.auth.AuthorizationValue;

// ... your code

  // build a authorization value
  AuthorizationValue mySpecialHeader = new AuthorizationValue()
    .keyName("x-special-access")  //  the name of the authorization to pass
    .value("i-am-special")        //  the value of the authorization
    .type("header");              //  the location, as either `header` or `query`

  // or in a single constructor
  AuthorizationValue apiKey = new AuthorizationValue("api_key", "special-key", "header");
  Swagger swagger = new SwaggerParser().read(
    "http://petstore.swagger.io/v2/swagger.json",
    Arrays.asList(mySpecialHeader, apiKey)
  );
```

### Prerequisites
You need the following installed and available in your $PATH:

* [Java 1.7](http://java.oracle.com)

Note!  Some folks have had issues with OOM errors with java version "1.6.0_51".  It's strongly suggested that you upgrade to 1.7!

* [Apache maven 3.0.3 or greater](http://maven.apache.org/)

After cloning the project, you can build it from source with this command:

```
mvn package
```

### Extensions
This project has a core artifact--`swagger-parser`, which uses Java Service Provider Inteface (SPI) so additional extensions can be added.  To read Swagger 1.0, 1.1, and 1.2 specifications, a module is included called `swagger-compat-spec-parser`.  This reads those older versions of the spec and produces 2.0 objects.

To build your own extension, you simply need to create a `src/main/resources/META-INF/services/io.swagger.parser.SwaggerParserExtension` file with the full classname of your implementation.  Your class must also implement the `io.swagger.parser.SwaggerParserExtension` interface.  Then, including your library with the `swagger-parser` module will cause it to be triggered automatically.

### Adding to your project
You can include this library from Sonatype OSS for SNAPSHOTS, or Maven central for releases.  In your dependencies:

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>io.swagger</groupId>
  <artifactId>swagger-parser</artifactId>
  <version>1.0.0</version>
</dependency>

```

To add swagger parsing support for older versions of swagger, add the `compat` module.  Since it depends on `swagger-parser`, you don't need to include both:
```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>io.swagger</groupId>
  <artifactId>swagger-compat-spec-parser</artifactId>
  <version>1.0.0</version>
</dependency>

```
